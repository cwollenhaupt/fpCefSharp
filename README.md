# fpCefSharp
## Introduction
With fpCefSharp you can add a modern browser to your Visual FoxPro application. It's a wrapper around CefSharp which wraps CEF for .NET applications. To host the browser control in a form you need an instance of fpDotNet.

More details can be found in my [Virtual FoxFest 2020 white paper](https://github.com/cwollenhaupt/fpCefSharp/blob/master/Demos/Files/Wollenhaupt_Browser.pdf).
