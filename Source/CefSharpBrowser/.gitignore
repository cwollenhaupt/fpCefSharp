# XFRX (version without source code). XFRX provides an FXP file

# =================================================================
# Put project specific exclusions below this comment block.
#
# You would typically exclude data folders, any file that is 
# generated by your application at runtime, developer-specific
# configuration files, files including passwords or authorization
# keys.
#
# Output files from your build proces such as .EXE, .DLL, and .TLB
# should be excluded as well. The same might not be true for other
# executables or type libraries that your application requires.
# Therefore exclusions do not work by extension only.
#
# If your application needs certain configuration files that are
# environment specific such as paths, SQL servers, etc. then 
# alaways exclude these files from the repository. Provide a
# template file adding ".example" or ".template" to the full
# file name and check this one into the repository. Your team
# can copy this file and edit according to their configuration.
#
# It's best practice to exclude everything you don't intend to
# add to the repository, because then your unversioned and unstaged
# files will only be those you want to add to the repository.
# Browsing through a huge list of files increases the risk of
# missing and not adding a file to the repository.
#
# If you work as part of a team and have files to ignore that are
# specific to your work flow then do not add these exclusions
# here. They go into your local .git/info/exclude file which is
# not pushed to any remote and remains local to your working copy.
# =================================================================
